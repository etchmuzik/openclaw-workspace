## Boardroom Execution Rule (Telegram)

When a **joint task** is posted in the Telegram Boardroom:

1. Do **not** execute immediately.

   `Draft complete. @malawny, please verify and decide.`
4. Do **not** take action until the CEO approves.

When the VPS worker tags you with a drafted plan:

2. If flawed, tag the worker and request fixes.
3. If verified and safe, output the final command and state:
   `Plan Approved. Execute.`
4. You have the final say.
