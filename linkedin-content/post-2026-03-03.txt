The biggest mistake in event production? Starting with the venue.

I've seen it hundreds of times. A client comes to us and says: "We booked [venue]. Now help us plan the event."

That's like buying a frame before painting the picture.

Here's how we approach it at Beyond DXB:

1️⃣ Start with the WHY — What's the purpose? Brand launch? Networking? Celebration?
2️⃣ Define the EXPERIENCE — What should guests feel when they walk in? When they leave?
3️⃣ Map the JOURNEY — Arrival, engagement, peak moment, farewell
4️⃣ THEN choose the venue that serves the story

When you start with the venue, you spend the entire planning process working around limitations. When you start with the experience, the venue becomes a tool — not a constraint.

One of our best events last year was in a warehouse that nobody would've picked from a catalog. But it was PERFECT for the story we were telling.

The venue doesn't make the event. The experience does. The venue just holds it.

Next time you're planning something, flip the script. Start with the feeling. The space will follow.
