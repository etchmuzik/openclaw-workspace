I don't hire for skills. I hire for chaos tolerance.

Event production is not a normal job. You can't prepare someone for the moment a keynote speaker's flight gets cancelled 4 hours before showtime. Or when the LED wall dies during rehearsal. Or when 200 extra guests show up unannounced.

What separates a good event team from a great one isn't technical ability — it's how they respond when everything goes sideways.

At Beyond DXB, here's what I look for:

🧠 Problem solvers, not problem reporters — Don't come to me with "we have a problem." Come with "we have a problem and here are three solutions."

⚡ Calm under pressure — If you panic, the client panics. If you're calm, the client trusts you.

🤝 Ego-free collaboration — On event day, titles disappear. Everyone does whatever needs doing.

🎯 Obsessive attention to detail — The difference between good and exceptional is in the details nobody notices.

💪 Stamina — Physical and mental. A 16-hour production day tests everything.

Our team is small but mighty. Every person on our crew has been through fire. And that's what makes us reliable.

To the Beyond DXB team: you are the reason clients come back. You are the reason I sleep at night (sometimes). You are the backbone of everything we build.

If you're in events — what's the one quality you value most in a teammate? 👇
