3 AM. The ballroom is empty. And this is my favorite part.

Most people see the final event — the lights, the music, the seamless flow. They don't see what happens 6 hours before doors open.

Last week, I was standing in an empty ballroom at 3 AM with my team. Cables everywhere. Truss going up. LED walls being calibrated pixel by pixel.

This is the part that doesn't make the highlight reel. But it's the part that makes everything else possible.

Here's what a typical load-in looks like for us:

🕐 2:00 AM — Trucks arrive, gear unloading begins
🕐 3:00 AM — Stage structure and truss rigging
🕐 5:00 AM — AV setup, LED wall calibration, sound check
🕐 7:00 AM — Lighting programming and focus
🕐 9:00 AM — Décor installation, furniture placement
🕐 11:00 AM — Full technical rehearsal
🕐 1:00 PM — Final walkthrough with client
🕐 3:00 PM — Team reset, brief, and energy check
🕐 5:00 PM — Doors open. Showtime.

15 hours of work for a 4-hour event. And that's just day-of.

The weeks of planning, design, vendor coordination, and client alignment that lead to this moment? That's another story entirely.

Next time you attend a flawless event, remember: someone was there at 3 AM making it possible.

Tag someone who's been on a 3 AM load-in crew 💪
