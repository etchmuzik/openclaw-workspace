🏆 "It can't be done in 3 weeks."

That's what we heard when InterContinental Dubai called us for their annual gala.

500 guests. Full AV production. Custom stage. Themed decor. 21 days.

Here's what we did differently:

→ Parallel workflows instead of sequential planning
→ AI-assisted proposal and design phase (saved 4 days)
→ Pre-built modular stage elements we could customize
→ A crew that thrives under pressure

The result?
✅ Delivered on time
✅ Under budget by 8%
✅ Client's words: "Best event we've ever hosted"

The lesson: "Impossible" timelines aren't impossible. They just require a different approach.

When was the last time someone told you "it can't be done" — and you proved them wrong?
