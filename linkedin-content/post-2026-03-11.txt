Stop treating your event budget like a spreadsheet. Start treating it like a story.

Every line item in your event budget should answer one question: "Does this serve the experience?"

I review event budgets every week — from clients, from competitors, from industry reports. And the #1 mistake I see?

Spending 60% on things guests will never notice. And 10% on the things they'll remember forever.

Here's how we reframe budgets at Beyond DXB:

❌ OLD WAY: Venue 40% | F&B 25% | AV 15% | Décor 10% | Other 10%

✅ BEYOND WAY: Peak moments 30% | Guest journey 25% | Atmosphere 20% | Operations 15% | Buffer 10%

What does this look like in practice?

→ Instead of an expensive venue, use a blank canvas space and invest in transformative design
→ Instead of a generic DJ, invest in a curated soundtrack that matches every phase of the event
→ Instead of flowers on every table, create one jaw-dropping installation that becomes the photo moment
→ Instead of printed programs, build a digital experience that extends engagement

The best events don't cost more. They allocate smarter.

Your budget tells the story of your priorities. Make sure it's telling the right story.
