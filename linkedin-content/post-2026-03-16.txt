Our Friday team ritual changed everything about how we work.

Every Friday at Beyond DXB, we do something unusual. We call it "The Debrief."

No matter how busy the week was — and in events, every week is busy — we stop for 90 minutes and do three things:

1️⃣ ROSES 🌹 — What went well this week? Every team member shares one win. Could be a client compliment, a problem they solved, or a personal achievement. We celebrate everything.

2️⃣ THORNS 🥀 — What went wrong? This is the hard part. No blame, no defensiveness. Just honest reflection. "The AV setup took 2 hours longer than planned because we didn't confirm the power specs." Facts, not feelings.

3️⃣ SEEDS 🌱 — What do we want to grow? Ideas, experiments, new approaches. "What if we created a pre-event checklist app?" "What if we started doing site visits differently?"

Why does this matter?

Because in event production, you're always sprinting to the next deadline. Without intentional reflection, you repeat the same mistakes. You burn out. You lose the creative spark.

The Debrief forces us to slow down and get better — not just busier.

Since we started this ritual:
→ Repeat mistakes dropped by 60%
→ Team satisfaction scores went up
→ Three of our best process improvements came from "Seeds"

Culture isn't about ping pong tables. It's about habits that make your team stronger every week.
