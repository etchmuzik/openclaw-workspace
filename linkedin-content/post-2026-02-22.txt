🎬 What goes into producing a 500-person corporate event in Dubai?

Here's a behind-the-scenes look at our process:

Day 1-3: Discovery
↳ Client brief, venue scouting, concept development
↳ We don't just ask "what do you want?" — we ask "how do you want people to feel?"

Day 4-7: Design & Planning
↳ 3D stage renders, lighting plots, AV specifications
↳ Vendor coordination, logistics mapping, contingency planning

Day 8-12: Pre-Production
↳ Equipment procurement, crew scheduling
↳ Rehearsals, technical dry runs, safety checks

Day 13-14: Build & Show
↳ 48-hour build window
↳ Sound check, lighting focus, final walkthrough
↳ Showtime 🎪

The magic isn't just in the event — it's in the 13 days nobody sees.
