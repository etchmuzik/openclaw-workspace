Ramadan Kareem to everyone celebrating 🌙

This is my favorite time of year in Dubai. The energy shifts. The city slows down just enough to breathe — and then comes alive in a completely different way after iftar.

At Beyond DXB, Ramadan is one of our busiest seasons. Suhoor gatherings, iftar experiences, corporate majlis setups, charity galas — the demand for meaningful, culturally respectful events skyrockets.

But here's what most people outside the region don't realize:

Ramadan events aren't just "events with different timing."

They require a completely different production philosophy:
→ Sound levels need to respect prayer times
→ Lighting design shifts to warm, intimate tones
→ F&B logistics revolve around precise iftar timing
→ Guest flow management changes entirely
→ Content and messaging must be culturally aligned

Every detail matters more during this month. Because Ramadan events aren't about spectacle — they're about connection, gratitude, and community.

This year, we're producing some incredible Ramadan experiences. I can't wait to share them with you.

To our clients, partners, and friends: Ramadan Mubarak. May this month bring you peace and purpose.
