A client came back to us after 2 years. The reason surprised me.

They didn't come back because of our production quality (though it's excellent, if I say so myself 😄).

They came back because of what happened AFTER the event.

Two years ago, we produced their annual conference. Great event, great feedback, project closed.

But here's what we did in those 2 years:

📩 Sent them a personalized recap 1 week after the event with metrics and insights
📩 Checked in 3 months later with industry trends relevant to their sector
📩 Congratulated them when they won an industry award (saw it on LinkedIn)
📩 Shared a case study from a similar project that might inspire their next event
📩 Sent a Ramadan greeting with a genuine personal note

No sales pitches. No "just checking if you have any events coming up." Just genuine relationship maintenance.

When their VP of Marketing needed an event partner for 2026, guess who was top of mind?

The secret to client retention in events isn't about the event. It's about everything in between.

At Beyond DXB, we track relationship touchpoints as carefully as we track production timelines. Because the event ends in one night — but the relationship should last years.

Here's the truth: acquiring a new client costs 5-7x more than retaining one. Yet most event companies spend 90% of their energy on new business.

Flip the ratio. Nurture your existing relationships. The ROI is incredible.
