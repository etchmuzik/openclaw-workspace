🌙 Ramadan is around the corner — and corporate iftar season is our busiest time.

After producing 50+ corporate iftars across the UAE, here are 5 things that make the difference:

1️⃣ Timing is Everything
Iftar isn't just dinner — it's a moment. The call to prayer, the first sip of water, breaking bread together. Your production timeline must honor this.

2️⃣ Blend Tradition with Innovation
Traditional Arabic hospitality meets modern production. Think: live oud music with subtle LED accents. Calligraphy projections on venue walls. Heritage, elevated.

3️⃣ Food is the Star
Your AV setup doesn't matter if the food disappoints. We always recommend allocating 40% of budget to F&B for iftars.

4️⃣ Create Space for Connection
Corporate iftars are about relationships, not presentations. Design the layout for conversation, not keynotes. Round tables > theater seating.

5️⃣ Give Back
The spirit of Ramadan is generosity. Include a charitable component — it resonates with guests and reflects well on the host.
