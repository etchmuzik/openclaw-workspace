We used AI to plan an event timeline last month. Here's what happened.

I'll be honest — I was skeptical. I've been doing this for years. Could a machine really understand the flow of a live event?

So we tested it. We fed our AI tool the event brief, guest count, venue specs, and production requirements. It generated a minute-by-minute run sheet.

The result?

It nailed about 70% of it. Transitions, buffer times, setup windows — surprisingly solid.

But that other 30%? That's where the human magic lives.

The AI didn't know that this particular client always runs 15 minutes late. It didn't account for the CEO's preference for a private moment before going on stage. It couldn't feel that the energy in the room needed a musical interlude, not a speaker transition.

Here's my take on AI in event production:

→ USE it for logistics, timelines, vendor coordination, budget tracking
→ USE it for generating creative concepts and brainstorming
→ DON'T rely on it for emotional intelligence and real-time adaptation
→ DON'T let it replace the instinct you've built over years of live events

AI is the best assistant we've ever had. But it's not the director. Not yet.
