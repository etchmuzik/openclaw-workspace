The event industry has a dirty secret: 80% of RFPs are decided before they're sent.

Harsh? Maybe. True? Absolutely.

After years of responding to RFPs in Dubai and across the GCC, I've learned something that changed how I run Beyond DXB:

The RFP is rarely the starting line. It's the finish line.

Here's what I mean:

By the time a company issues an RFP, they usually have:
→ A preferred vendor they've already been talking to
→ A budget that was shaped by someone's recommendation
→ Evaluation criteria designed around a specific approach

The companies that win RFPs consistently aren't the ones with the best proposals. They're the ones who were in the conversation 6 months before the RFP dropped.

So how do you get into that conversation?

1️⃣ Build relationships before you need them — Coffee meetings, industry events, genuine connections. Not when the RFP drops. Before.

2️⃣ Share expertise freely — LinkedIn posts, case studies, speaking engagements. Become the person they think of when "event production" comes up.

3️⃣ Solve small problems first — Offer value upfront. Help with a minor event. Be useful before the big opportunity arrives.

4️⃣ Stay visible — Regular touchpoints. Not spam. Genuine check-ins. Share relevant industry insights.

We stopped chasing RFPs and started building relationships. Our win rate went from 15% to 45%.

Stop responding to RFPs. Start creating opportunities.
