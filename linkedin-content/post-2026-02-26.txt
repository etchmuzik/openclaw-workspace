🤖 We just cut our event proposal turnaround from 5 days to 5 hours.

No, we didn't fire anyone. We gave our team superpowers.

Here's our AI-powered event production workflow:

𝟏. Brief Analysis
AI parses the client brief, extracts key requirements, flags potential issues before any human reads it.

𝟐. Proposal Generation
First draft of scope, timeline, and budget generated automatically. Our team refines, not creates from scratch.

𝟑. 3D Visualization
AI-assisted stage and layout renders in minutes. Client sees their event before we build it.

𝟒. Vendor Matching
Smart matching based on budget, availability, past performance. No more calling 15 suppliers for quotes.

𝟓. Risk Assessment
Pattern recognition across 200+ past events to predict and prevent common issues.

The creative decisions? Still 100% human.
The repetitive work? That's where AI shines.

Result: Our team focuses on what they do best — creating unforgettable experiences.

How is AI changing YOUR industry? I'd love to hear 👇
