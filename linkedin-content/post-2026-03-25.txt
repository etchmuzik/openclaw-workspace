I asked our newest team member what surprised her most about event production. Her answer was gold.

She said: "I thought event production was about creativity. It's actually about logistics that enable creativity."

She's been with us for 3 months, and she already gets it.

Here's the truth most people outside our industry don't understand:

For every 1 hour of creative magic on event day, there are 100 hours of:

📊 Spreadsheets — Budgets, timelines, vendor matrices, guest lists, seating plans
📞 Calls — Confirmations, negotiations, troubleshooting, client updates
📝 Documentation — Contracts, insurance, permits, risk assessments, production books
🚗 Site visits — Power checks, load-in routes, ceiling heights, emergency exits
🔧 Problem solving — "The custom piece doesn't fit through the door. Now what?"

The glamorous 1% is built on the unglamorous 99%.

And here's what I tell every new team member at Beyond DXB:

"Fall in love with the logistics. Because that's where you'll spend most of your time. The creative moments are the reward. The operational excellence is the work."

The best event producers I know aren't the most creative people in the room. They're the most organized, most adaptable, most detail-obsessed people — who also happen to have great taste.

To everyone considering a career in events: it's the most rewarding industry in the world. But go in with your eyes open.
