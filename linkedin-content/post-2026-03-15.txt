Our client's product launch generated AED 2.3M in deals closed at the event. Here's the formula.

Most product launches focus on the product. We focus on the buyer journey.

A fintech startup came to us with a challenge: they needed their launch event to directly drive sales pipeline. Not "brand awareness." Not "engagement." Actual revenue.

Here's the experience architecture we built:

🎯 Phase 1: Pre-Event (2 weeks before)
Personalized video invitations to 200 qualified prospects. Each video mentioned the prospect's specific pain point. Attendance rate: 78% (industry average: 35%).

🎯 Phase 2: The Experience (Event day)
→ Interactive demo stations, not passive presentations
→ Each station designed around a specific use case
→ "Problem → Solution → Proof" flow at every touchpoint
→ Real-time ROI calculator guests could use with their own data

🎯 Phase 3: The Close (During event)
→ Private meeting rooms available for on-the-spot conversations
→ Sales team briefed on each attendee's profile
→ Special event-only pricing created urgency

🎯 Phase 4: Follow-up (48 hours after)
→ Personalized recap videos sent to every attendee
→ Specific next steps based on which stations they visited

Result: AED 2.3M in signed deals within 30 days.

Events aren't expenses. They're revenue engines — when designed correctly.
