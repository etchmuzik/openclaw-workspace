I turned down a AED 500,000 project last month. Here's why.

The brief looked amazing on paper. Big brand. Big budget. High-profile event.

But something felt off in the first meeting.

The client wanted us to execute their exact vision — no creative input, no production recommendations, no flexibility. Essentially, they wanted a pair of hands, not a partner.

And I've learned this lesson the hard way: when a client doesn't value your expertise, the project always goes wrong.

Here's what happens when you take "execution only" projects:

❌ Problems arise that you warned about — but weren't allowed to prevent
❌ The client blames you for outcomes you had no control over
❌ Your team burns out working against their own instincts
❌ Your reputation gets attached to work you're not proud of

Here's what I told the client:

"We would love to work with you. But Beyond DXB's value isn't in our equipment or our labor — it's in our thinking. If you want a production company that just follows orders, we're not the right fit. If you want a partner who'll challenge you and make the event better than you imagined — let's talk."

They went with someone else. And that's okay.

Saying no to wrong-fit projects is the most important business skill I've developed. It protects your team, your brand, and your sanity.

Not every opportunity is your opportunity.
