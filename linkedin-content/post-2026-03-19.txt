What nobody tells you about managing 15 vendors on a single event day.

Last Thursday, we produced a gala dinner with:
- 1 venue team
- 1 catering company
- 2 AV suppliers
- 1 lighting designer
- 1 staging company
- 1 florist
- 2 entertainment acts
- 1 photographer
- 1 videographer
- 1 valet service
- 1 security team
- 1 furniture rental
- 1 gifting company

15 vendors. 15 different timelines. 15 different contact persons. 1 event that needed to feel seamless.

Here's what goes wrong when vendor management isn't airtight:

❌ The florist arrives at the same time as staging — they're fighting for floor space
❌ The caterer needs kitchen access but security hasn't been briefed
❌ The AV team's power requirements exceed what the venue provided
❌ Entertainment shows up at load-in time instead of rehearsal time

Here's how we prevent chaos at Beyond DXB:

📋 Master timeline — Every vendor gets a customized schedule with THEIR specific windows
📋 Single point of contact — Vendors talk to us, not to each other and not to the client
📋 Site plan with zones — Every team knows exactly where they work and when
📋 WhatsApp command center — Real-time coordination group with strict communication protocols
📋 Buffer time — 30 minutes between every major setup phase

The client sees magic. We see logistics chess.
