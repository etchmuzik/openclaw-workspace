Dubai taught me something about business that no MBA ever could.

When I started Beyond DXB, I thought success was about having the best service. The best portfolio. The best pitch deck.

I was wrong.

In Dubai, success is about TRUST. And trust is built differently here.

Here are 5 things I've learned about doing business in this city:

1️⃣ Relationships come before transactions — People do business with people they trust. Coffee meetings matter more than cold emails.

2️⃣ Speed is a superpower — Dubai moves fast. If you can deliver in 48 hours what others deliver in 2 weeks, you win. Every time.

3️⃣ Cultural intelligence is non-negotiable — This city has 200+ nationalities. Understanding cultural nuances isn't a "nice to have" — it's your competitive edge.

4️⃣ Your word is your bond — In this market, reputation travels faster than any marketing campaign. One broken promise can cost you a year of pipeline.

5️⃣ Think big, start now — Dubai doesn't wait for "perfect." The city rewards action. Launch, iterate, improve.

Three years in, I can tell you: Dubai is the best city in the world to build a business. Not because it's easy — but because it rewards the bold.
