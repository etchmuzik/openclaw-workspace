The last 10 days of Ramadan are different. And I want to talk about it honestly.

As a business owner, I'll be transparent: the last third of Ramadan is the hardest to balance.

Spiritually, these are the most important nights. Laylat al-Qadr — the Night of Power — falls within them. It's a time for deep reflection, extra prayers, and disconnecting from the world.

Professionally, it's also peak event season. Ramadan gatherings intensify. Clients want their best events in the final stretch.

Here's how I navigate this tension:

🕌 I block time that's non-negotiable — Late night prayers are not meetings I reschedule. My team knows this. My clients respect it.

📋 I plan ahead — Knowing these 10 days are coming, we front-load production work in the first 20 days. By the final stretch, execution is on autopilot.

🤝 I delegate with trust — This is when team empowerment really shows. If I've built the right team, they don't need me every hour.

🧘 I accept imperfection — Not every email gets answered immediately. Not every opportunity gets chased. And that's okay.

The beauty of being an entrepreneur is building a business that reflects your values — not one that overrides them.

Ramadan teaches balance. The world doesn't stop, but you learn to move through it with more intention.

To every professional balancing faith and business this month — you're doing great. Keep going.
