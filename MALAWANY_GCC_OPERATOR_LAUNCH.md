# Malawany GCC Operator Launch (v1)

Owner: Etch
Status: STARTED
Date: 2026-02-24

## North Star (90 days)
Build Malawany into a GCC-first autonomous operator that can:
- publish on X daily
- run outreach and follow-ups
- generate qualified leads
- report performance and self-improve weekly

## Constraints
- Malawany is main mind (protected)
- Any high-risk/public action can be gated by approval until confidence is high
- Keep compliance-conscious messaging for GCC markets

## Stage Plan

### Stage 1 — Foundation (Days 1–7)
1. Positioning + offer definition (GCC/MENA)
2. Content system for X (pillars, hooks, CTA templates)
3. Outreach system (ICP, lead sources, sequence templates)
4. KPI dashboard schema (posts, replies, leads, meetings)

### Stage 2 — Controlled Autonomy (Days 8–21)
1. Daily content generation + scheduled posting
2. Outreach drafts + follow-up cadence
3. Daily summary at fixed time
4. Weekly optimization memo (what to keep/kill/test)

### Stage 3 — Full Operator Loop (Days 22–60)
1. Auto experiments (hook style, posting times, CTA variants)
2. Lead scoring + priority queue
3. Revenue-linked reporting
4. SOP expansion (vertical-specific playbooks)

## Initial ICP (start narrow)
- UAE/KSA founders (services, agencies, event/marketing operators)
- Pain: inconsistent pipeline + weak content consistency
- Promise: predictable visibility + lead flow from content + outbound

## Core Content Pillars for X
1. AI Operator lessons from real execution
2. GCC business growth systems (practical, no fluff)
3. Automation breakdowns (before/after)
4. Case-study style mini threads
5. Contrarian takes on AI hype vs actual ops

## Outreach Engine (v1)
- Source: founder lists / niche communities / LinkedIn-to-X mapping
- Sequence: Intro → Value proof → Light CTA → Follow-up 1 → Follow-up 2
- Tone: concise, respectful, proof-first

## KPI Targets (first 30 days)
- 30+ posts published
- 100+ qualified outbound touches
- 20+ meaningful conversations
- 5+ booked discovery calls

## Daily Operating Loop (target)
1. Generate + publish content
2. Run outreach batch
3. Reply to inbound
4. Update CRM/sheet
5. Send end-of-day report
