## 📝 POST CONTENT

We've been quietly building something for the past 6 months.

Today, I'm excited to share that we just shipped our biggest product update yet.

**What's new:**
✅ 40% faster load times
✅ Completely redesigned dashboard
✅ New automation workflows
✅ Mobile app now in beta

But the feature I'm most proud of? 

The one that took 3 redesigns and 2 weeks of user testing: our new onboarding flow.

Because great features don't matter if people can't figure out how to use them.

**Behind the numbers:**
- 12 team members
- 847 commits
- 23 user interviews
- 1 very tired but proud team

Shoutout to every customer who gave feedback, reported bugs, and pushed us to be better.

This is just the beginning.
