3 habits that changed how I build software:

**1. Write the README first**
Before writing code, write what it does and why. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.

**2. Commit messages are documentation**
"Fixed bug" helps no one. "Fixed memory leak in user auth by closing DB connections" saves future you 20 minutes.

**3. Delete code aggressively**
Unused features are liabilities. The best code is the code you didn't write.

Small changes. Compound results.

My codebase is cleaner, my team's happier, and onboarding new devs takes half the time.

What's one habit that changed how you work?
