Just spent the last 48 hours debugging what I thought was a "simple" API integration.

Turns out, the issue wasn't the code—it was assuming the documentation was current.

**The lesson?** 
When something "should work" but doesn't, question your assumptions before rewriting everything.

Sometimes the fix is a single line. Sometimes it's realizing you've been reading v1 docs while using v2 endpoints.

Three questions I now ask before any integration:
1. When was the last time this doc was updated?
2. What's the deprecation timeline?
3. Is there a newer SDK I'm not using?

Saved myself 6 hours on the last project with this checklist.

What assumptions have cost you the most time lately?
