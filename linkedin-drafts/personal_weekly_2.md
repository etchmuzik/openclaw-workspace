The "AI will replace developers" narrative misses something crucial.

I've been experimenting with AI coding tools for 18 months. Here's what actually happened:

❌ **What didn't change:**
- Architecture decisions
- Understanding user needs
- Debugging complex issues
- Code review quality

✅ **What changed:**
- Boilerplate takes 10% of the time
- I prototype 3x faster
- Learning new languages is easier
- More time thinking, less time typing

The developers I see thriving aren't the ones fighting AI.

They're the ones using it to level up their thinking while AI handles the syntax.

The job isn't dying—it's evolving. Same as it did with IDEs, Stack Overflow, and cloud platforms.

**Question:** How are you adapting your workflow to AI tools?
