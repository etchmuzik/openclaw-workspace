# Malawany Knowledge System (Tiago Forte Inspired)

This workspace now follows a practical **PARA + CODE** system:

- **PARA** = Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive
- **CODE** = Capture, Organize, Distill, Express

## Folder map
- `knowledge/projects/` — active outcomes with deadlines
- `knowledge/areas/` — ongoing responsibilities (no end date)
- `knowledge/resources/` — reference notes/templates/research
- `knowledge/archive/` — completed/inactive material
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily operational log (single source of truth)
- `knowledge/PRIORITIES.md` — priority stack and MITs (most important tasks)

## Daily workflow (non-negotiable)
1. **Capture** key facts/decisions/tasks into `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Organize** each item into the correct PARA bucket
3. **Distill** into short bullets: decision, why, next action
4. **Express** through action (post, outreach, build, report)

## Priority system
Use **P1/P2/P3 + MITs**:
- **P1** = critical, must move today
- **P2** = important, schedule today/this week
- **P3** = nice-to-have, backlog
- **MIT-1..3** = top three outcomes for the day

## Logging standard for every important interaction
For every meaningful decision/event, log:
- Context
- Decision
- Owner
- Deadline
- Next action

## Nightly review rule (2:00 AM)
A scheduled review consolidates the day into:
- updated priorities
- project status
- distilled lessons
- memory updates
