# Malawany — Hire an AI Operator (Landing Page Copy)

## Hero
**Turn AI into a real team member.**
Not a chatbot. Not a demo. A colleague with memory, tools, and a real job.

Primary CTA: **Get the Playbook**
Secondary CTA: **Book an Operator Sprint**

---

## Subheadline
The practical GCC-first system for founders and operators who want an AI that runs daily work: content, outreach, follow-ups, reporting, and execution.

---

## Problem Section
Most teams use AI for one-off prompts.
That gives fast answers, but zero operational leverage.

What businesses actually need:
- Consistency
- Memory across days and projects
- Tool access
- Delegation and quality control
- Safety rails

---

## Solution Section
## How to Hire an AI Operator
A practical playbook for giving AI a real job inside your business.

What you’ll implement:
- Identity design (SOUL.md, role, voice, constraints)
- 3-layer memory architecture that compounds over time
- Tool access + sub-agent delegation patterns
- Safety rails and trust ladder for autonomous actions
- Daily operating rhythms (what runs, when, and why)
- Coding-agent loops for faster product execution
- Copy-paste templates to launch in one afternoon

---

## What You Get
- Playbook (EN + GCC-ready examples)
- Templates: SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, MEMORY.md, guardrails
- Daily/weekly operating checklist
- KPI dashboard schema
- Launch scripts for first 14 days

---

## Who This Is For
- Founders and operators in UAE/KSA/GCC
- Agencies, event operators, growth teams, technical SMEs
- Anyone who wants an AI operator that executes reliably

Not ideal for:
- People looking for a generic prompt list
- Teams unwilling to run processes and accountability

---

## Outcome Promise
By the end of implementation, your AI operator should be able to:
- Publish content on schedule
- Run outbound outreach with follow-up discipline
- Maintain context across tasks and days
- Produce daily and weekly performance summaries
- Escalate only when needed

**Is this just another chatbot setup?**
No. This is an operational system with identity, memory, tools, and governance.

**Can this work in Arabic and English?**
Yes. We design bilingual execution by default for GCC contexts.

**Is full autonomy safe?**
We use staged autonomy: controlled → semi-autonomous → full operator mode.

**Do I need a technical team?**
Not for the Playbook. For advanced automations, the Sprint helps you ship faster.
